  - Stock Symbol (e.g., MSFT)

  - XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)
  - Total Return
  - Annualized Return
  - Weighted Average Holding Time

## Data Storage

The application uses Streamlit's session state to store transaction data during the session. Data persists only while the application is running.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly
- yfinance

## Notes

- Stock data is fetched using the Yahoo Finance API through the `yfinance` package
- All calculations are performed in real-time using current market prices
- The application supports multiple currencies but assumes all transactions are in the same currency

## Limitations

- Data is not persisted between sessions
- Real-time price updates depend on the Yahoo Finance API availability
- Performance calculations may take longer with a large number of transactions
